# Philosophers
### ***The specific rules for the mandatory part are:***
- Each philosopher should be a ***thread***.
- One fork between each philosopher, therefore if they are multiple philosophers, there will be a fork at the right and the left of each philosopher.
- To avoid philosophers duplicating forks, you should protect the forks state with a ***mutex*** for each of them.
### ***Run:***
```

>The program should take the following arguments: 
>- number_of_philosophers: is the number of philosophers and also the number of forks (< 200).
>- time_to_die: is in milliseconds, if a philosopher doesn’t start eating ’time_to_die’ milliseconds after starting their last meal or the beginning of the simulation, it dies (> 60 ms).
>- time_to_eat: is in milliseconds and is the time it takes for a philosopher to eat. During that time they will need to keep the two forks (> 60 ms).
>- time_to_sleep: is in milliseconds and is the time the philosopher will spend sleeping (> 60 ms).
>- number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat: argument is optional, if all philosophers eat at least ’number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat’ the simulation will stop. If not specified, the simulation will stop only at the death of a philosopher.
### ***The specific rules for the bonus part are:***
- All the forks are in the middle of the table.
- They have no states in memory but the number of available forks is represented by a ***semaphore***.
- Each philosopher should be a ***process*** and the main process should not be a philosopher.
